# Mortgage-Calculator
A Python program that calculates your monthly mortgage payment based on your loan amount and other factors.

All you have to do is to enter your loan amount (ex: 300000),
and your percent down payment without the percent sign (ex: 20).
The program then tells you the amount of money that would be.
Next enter the interest rate, again without a percent sign (ex: 3.5),
and the loan term (ex: 30).
Finally, add up and enter any other monthly expenses you might have (ex: 350). If none, just enter 0.
